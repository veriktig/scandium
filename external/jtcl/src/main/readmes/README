JTcl - Tcl Language Interpreter in Java

https://jtcl-project.github.io/jtcl/

JTcl is an implementation of Tcl (Tool Command Language) written in Java.
JTcl implements a large extent of Tcl 8.4 syntax and commands, limited 
only by API restrictions of the Java Virtual Machine.  JTcl is based on 
the Jacl interpreter (http://tcljava.sf.net)


INSTALLING JTCL

JTcl requires a Java JVM 1.5 or higher (Java 1.6+ is recommended).  You may 
have to install Java if you don't already have it installed.  

Download JTcl distribution from: 

    https://github.com/jtcl-project/jtcl/releases

JTcl is distributed as a ZIP archive.  Download the latest 
jtcl-{version}-bin.zip file from the JTcl website, and unzip into a directory 
of your choice.  

Unix/Linux/Mac OSX shell script (`jtcl') and Windows batch file (`jtcl.bat') 
are included.   Unix/Linux/OSX users may want to make a symbolic link
in /usr/local/bin (or any other directory on your PATH of your choice):

Non-interactive versions are also included, `jtclni' and `jtclni.bat'.  These
scripts start JTcl with a command shell that does not print command prompts, and
are useful when stdin is a pipe or redirected from a file.
