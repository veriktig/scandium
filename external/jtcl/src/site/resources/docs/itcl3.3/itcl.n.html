<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> provides object-oriented extensions to Tcl, much as
C++ provides object-oriented extensions to C.  The emphasis of this
work, however, is not to create a whiz-bang object-oriented
programming environment.  Rather, it is to support more structured
programming practices in Tcl without changing the flavor of the language.
More than anything else, <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> provides a means of
encapsulating related procedures together with their shared data
in a namespace that is hidden from the outside world.
It encourages better programming by promoting the object-oriented
&quot;library&quot; mindset.  It also allows for code re-use through inheritance.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CLASSES</H2>

<P>

The fundamental construct in <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> is the class definition.
Each class acts as a template for actual objects that can be created.
Each object has its own unique bundle of data, which contains instances
of the &quot;variables&quot; defined in the class.  Special procedures called
&quot;methods&quot; are used to manipulate individual objects.  Methods are just
like the operations that are used to manipulate Tk widgets.  The
&quot;<B>button</B>&quot; widget, for example, has methods such as &quot;flash&quot; and
&quot;invoke&quot; that cause a particular button to blink and invoke its command.
<P>

Within the body of a method, the &quot;variables&quot; defined in the class
are automatically available.  They need not be declared with anything
like the <B>global</B> command.  Within another class method, a method
can be invoked like any other command-simply by using its name.
From any other context, the method name must be prefaced by an object
name, which provides a context for the data that the method can access.
<P>

Each class has its own namespace containing things that are common
to all objects which belong to the class.  For example, &quot;common&quot; data
members are shared by all objects in the class.  They are global
variables that exist in the class namespace, but since they are
included in the class definition, they need not be declared using
the <B>global</B> command; they are automatically available to any
code executing in the class context.  A class can also create
ordinary global variables, but these must be declared using the
<B>global</B> command each time they are used.
<P>

Classes can also have ordinary procedures declared as &quot;procs&quot;.
Within another class method or proc, a proc can be invoked like
any other command-simply by using its name.  From any other context,
the procedure name should be qualified with the class namespace
like &quot;<I>className</I><B>::</B><I>proc</I>&quot;.  Class procs execute in the
class context, and therefore have automatic access to all &quot;common&quot;
data members.  However, they cannot access object-specific &quot;variables&quot;,
since they are invoked without reference to any specific object.
They are usually used to perform generic operations which affect
all objects belonging to the class.
<P>

Each of the elements in a class can be declared &quot;public&quot;, &quot;protected&quot;
or &quot;private&quot;.  Public elements can be accessed by the class, by
derived classes (other classes that inherit this class), and by
external clients that use the class.  Protected elements can be
accessed by the class, and by derived classes.  Private elements
are only accessible in the class where they are defined.
<P>

The &quot;public&quot; elements within a class define its interface to the
external world.  Public methods define the operations that can
be used to manipulate an object.  Public variables are recognized
as configuration options by the &quot;configure&quot; and &quot;cget&quot; methods
that are built into each class.  The public interface says
<I>what</I> an object will do but not <I>how</I> it will do it.
Protected and private members, along with the bodies of class
methods and procs, provide the implementation details.  Insulating
the application developer from these details leaves the class designer
free to change them at any time, without warning, and without affecting
programs that rely on the class.  It is precisely this encapsulation
that makes object-oriented programs easier to understand and maintain.
<P>

The fact that <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> objects look like Tk widgets is
no accident.  <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> was designed this way, to blend
naturally into a Tcl/Tk application.  But <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B>
extends the Tk paradigm from being merely object-based to being
fully object-oriented.  An object-oriented system supports
inheritance, allowing classes to share common behaviors by
inheriting them from an ancestor or base class.  Having a base
class as a common abstraction allows a programmer to treat
related classes in a similar manner.  For example, a toaster
and a blender perform different (specialized) functions, but
both share the abstraction of being appliances.  By abstracting
common behaviors into a base class, code can be <I>shared</I> rather
than <I>copied</I>.  The resulting application is easier to
understand and maintain, and derived classes (e.g., specialized
appliances) can be added or removed more easily.
<P>

This description was merely a brief overview of object-oriented
programming and <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B>.  A more tutorial introduction is
presented in the paper included with this distribution.  See the
<B>class</B> command for more details on creating and using classes.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAMESPACES</H2>

<P>

<B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> now includes a complete namespace facility.
A namespace is a collection of commands and global variables that
is kept apart from the usual global scope.  This allows Tcl code
libraries to be packaged in a well-defined manner, and prevents
unwanted interactions with other libraries.  A namespace can also
have child namespaces within it, so one library can contain its
own private copy of many other libraries.  A namespace can also
be used to wrap up a group of related classes.  The global scope
(named &quot;::&quot;) is the root namespace for an interpreter; all
other namespaces are contained within it.
<P>

See the <B>namespace</B> command for details on creating and
using namespaces.

<H2>MEGA-WIDGETS</H2>

<P>

Mega-widgets are high-level widgets that are constructed using
Tk widgets as component parts, usually without any C code.  A
fileselectionbox, for example, may have a few listboxes, some
entry widgets and some control buttons.  These individual widgets
are put together in a way that makes them act like one big
widget.
<P>

<B>[incr&nbsp;Tk]</B> is a framework for building mega-widgets.  It
uses <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> to support the object paradigm, and adds
base classes which provide default widget behaviors.  See the
<B>itk</B> man page for more details.
<P>

<B>[incr&nbsp;Widgets]</B> is a library of mega-widgets built using
<B>[incr&nbsp;Tk]</B>.  It contains more than 30 different widget
classes that can be used right out of the box to build Tcl/Tk
applications.  Each widget class has its own man page describing
the features available.
