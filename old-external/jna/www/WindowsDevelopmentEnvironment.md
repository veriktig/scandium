Setting up a Windows Development Environment
============================================

Java
----

For a 32-bit build, set `JAVA_HOME` to a 32-bit JDK, eg. `C:\Program Files (x86)\java\jdk1.6.0_24`. 
For a 64-bit build, set `JAVA_HOME` to a 64-bit JDK, eg. `C:\Program Files\java\jdk1.6.0_24`. 

Native
------

### MSVC / Visual Studio

JNA uses the free MS Visual Studio C++ Express compiler to compile
native bits if MSVC is set in the environment. The MS compiler provides
structured event handling (SEH), which allows JNA to trap native faults when
run in protected mode. 

On 64-bit windows, you will still need to install mingw64 in order to
compile a small bit of inline assembly.

To use the MS compiler, ensure that the appropriate 32-bit or 64-bit versions
of cl.exe/ml.exe/ml64.exe/link.exe are in your PATH and that the INCLUDE and
LIB environment variables are set properly (as in VCVARS.BAT). 

Sample configuration setting up INCLUDE/LIB (see an alternative below):

``` shell
export MSVC="/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0/vc"
export WSDK="/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v7.0A"
export WSDK_64="/c/Program Files/Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v7.1"

export INCLUDE="$(cygpath -m "$MSVC")/include;$(cygpath -m "$WSDK")/include"
# for 64-bit target
export LIB="$(cygpath -m "$MSVC")/lib/amd64;$(cygpath -m "$WSDK_64")/lib/x64"
# for 32-bit target
export LIB="$(cygpath -m "$MSVC")/lib;$(cygpath -m "$WSDK")/lib"
```

### mingw

Install [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/).

When installing cygwin, include ssh, git, make, autotools, and mingw{32|64}-g++.
Ensure the mingw compiler (i686-pc-mingw32-gcc.exe or i686-pc-mingw64-gcc.exe) is on your path.

If `cl.exe` is found on your %PATH%, you'll need to invoke `ant native
-DUSE_MSVC=false` in order to avoid using the MS compiler.

### Issues

#### Backslash R Command Not Found

If you get errors such as `'\r': command not found`, run `dos2unix -f [filename]`
for each file that it's complaining about.

### Building

Type `ant` from the top to build the project.

Recipe for building on windows
------------------------------

This is the contents of a note I made for myself to be able to build JNA on
windows.

This builds the library based on the Visual C++ compiler.

<pre>
0. Start-Point: A clean Windows 10 Installation with all patches as of 2017-11-05
1. Install Visual C++ Build Tools 2015 (http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) (the 8.1 SDK is enough)
2. Install Oracle JDK 8u152 (64 bit)
3. Install Cygwin 64 Bit (https://cygwin.com/install.html)
	- make
	- automake
	- automake1.15
	- libtool
	- mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++ (Version 5.4.0-4)
	- mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core (Version 5.4.0-4)
	- gcc-g++
	- diffutils
        - git 
4. Ensure ant, maven, cygwin (64 Bit!) are accessible from the PATH
5. Run 
	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools\vcbuildtools.bat" x64
   inside a windows command prompt
6. Point JAVA_HOME to the root of a 64 Bit JDK
7. Run native build

For 32bit:

0. Start-Point: A clean Windows 10 Installation with all patches as of 2017-11-05
1. Install Visual C++ Build Tools 2015 (http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) (the 8.1 SDK is enough)
2. Install Oracle JDK 8u152 (32 bit)
3. Install Cygwin 32 Bit (https://cygwin.com/install.html)
	- make
	- automake
	- automake1.15
	- libtool
        - mingw64-i686-gcc-g++ (Version 5.4.0-4)
        - mingw64-i686-gcc-core (Version 5.4.0-4)
	- gcc-g++
	- diffutils
        - git 
4. Ensure ant, maven, cygwin (32 Bit!) are accessible from the PATH
5. Run 
	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools\vcbuildtools.bat" x86
   inside a windows command prompt
6. Point JAVA_HOME to the root of a 32 Bit JDK
7. Run native build
</pre>

To build without Visual C++, using only Cygwin, just skip steps 1 and 5.
