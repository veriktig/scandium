<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The following global variables are created and managed automatically
by the <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> library.  Except where noted below, these
variables should normally be treated as read-only by application-specific
code and by users.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>itcl::library</B><DD>
When an interpreter is created, <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> initializes this variable
to hold the name of a directory containing the system library of
<B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> scripts.  The initial value of <B>itcl::library</B>
is set from the ITCL_LIBRARY environment variable if it exists,
or from a compiled-in value otherwise.
<DT><B>itcl::patchLevel</B><DD>
When an interpreter is created, <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> initializes this
variable to hold the current patch level for <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B>.
For example, the value &quot;<B>2.0p1</B>&quot; indicates <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B>
version 2.0 with the first set of patches applied.
<DT><B>itcl::purist</B><DD>
When an interpreter is created containing Tcl/Tk and the
<B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> namespace facility, this variable controls
a &quot;backward-compatibility&quot; mode for widget access.
<P>
In vanilla Tcl/Tk, there is a single pool of commands, so the
access command for a widget is the same as the window name.
When a widget is created within a namespace, however, its access
command is installed in that namespace, and should be accessed
outside of the namespace using a qualified name.  For example,

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

namespace foo {
    namespace bar {
        button .b -text &quot;Testing&quot;
    }
}
foo::bar::.b configure -background red
pack .b

</PRE>

</DL>


Note that the window name &quot;.b&quot; is still used in conjunction
with commands like <B>pack</B> and <B>destroy</B>.  However, the
access command for the widget (i.e., name that appears as the
<I>first</I> argument on a command line) must be more specific.
<P>
The &quot;<B>winfo command</B>&quot; command can be used to query the
fully-qualified access command for any widget, so one can write:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

[winfo command .b] configure -background red

</PRE>

</DL>


and this is good practice when writing library procedures.  Also,
in conjunction with the <B>bind</B> command, the &quot;%q&quot; field can be
used in place of &quot;%W&quot; as the access command:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

bind Button &lt;Key-Return&gt; {%q flash; %q invoke}

</PRE>

</DL>


While this behavior makes sense from the standpoint of encapsulation,
it causes problems with existing Tcl/Tk applications.  Many existing
applications are written with bindings that use &quot;%W&quot;.  Many
library procedures assume that the window name is the access
command.
<P>
The <B>itcl::purist</B> variable controls a backward-compatibility
mode.  By default, this variable is &quot;0&quot;, and the window name
can be used as an access command in any context.  Whenever the
<B>unknown</B> procedure stumbles across a widget name, it simply
uses &quot;<B>winfo command</B>&quot; to determine the appropriate command
name.  If this variable is set to &quot;1&quot;, this backward-compatibility
mode is disabled.  This gives better encapsulation, but using the
window name as the access command may lead to &quot;invalid command&quot;
errors.
<DT><B>itcl::version</B><DD>
When an interpreter is created, <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B> initializes this
variable to hold the version number of the form <I>x.y</I>.
Changes to <I>x</I> represent major changes with probable
incompatibilities and changes to <I>y</I> represent small enhancements
and bug fixes that retain backward compatibility.
